        <div class="card__content">The ML Team focuses on solving data-driven problems in the real-world, industrial and research scenarios. They often handle large amounts of data and have also worked on optimised intelligence algorithms.<br><br>Current research teams are focused on deploying sophisticated models on wearables and other resource-constrained devices (edge devices). Research groups implement models with low-memory footprint to analyse sensor data for healthcare applications.</div>

        <div class="card__content">The <b>Adversarial Attacks</b> team works on making Deep Learning models robust to adversarial attacks. They previously worked on defending against physically plausible adversarial patch attacks.<br><br>The <b>Federated Learning</b> team trains models across different data sites holding local data samples, and makes their models gain experience from various datasets without sharing the training data.</div>

        <div class="card__content">The <b>Computer Vision</b> research subgroup focuses on the detection of objects and events from image and video data. Latest research by the team include real-time surveillance-based crime detection.<br><br>The <b>Natural Language Processing</b> team works on tasks like classification, sentiment analysis and machine translation. The most recent work in this domain introduced a Multi-Context Transformer architecture for Sign Language Translation.</div>
